# Loan Application Data
Here, I explore a loan application dataset of over 600 applicants to find out factors that could have contributed to their application decision. I also create a slide presentation deck from the jupyter notebook containing the codes specifically to visualize my results. Most of my exploratory and explanatory visualizations are done with seaborn.
